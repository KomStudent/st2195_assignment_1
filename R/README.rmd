# R Script to print Integers 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10)
# Munroe_Karl
# ST2195
# Assignment 1 part a)

#use the seq() function to generate number sequence

seq(from=1,to=10)

```

### Python Code
```{python}

#init variables
strNumList = ""
counter = 0

#loop to generate the output
for i in range(10):
    counter = i + 1 # i will start at 0
    strNumList = strNumList + str(counter) + " "
print(strNumList) # print the list
